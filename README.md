# ROMS-Functions
Functions to extract data from the Great Barrier Reef ROMS ocean model (Sandery et al 2019).

These were made for a specific purpose (extract environment variables to match specific dates and locations) so may not be useful for everything.
The functions are not built for speed so can be improved.

Largely built off the `angstroms` package
