# ROMS-Functions
Functions to extract data from the Great Barrier Reef ROMS ocean model (Sandery et al 2019).

These were made for a specific purpose but should be applicable to most ROMS models (if the code is editted).
The functions are not built for speed so can be improved.

Largely built off the `angstroms` package
